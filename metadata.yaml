description: "The Way of Peace is a New Thought book written by James Allen. Although\
  \ Allen is more widely known for his As a Man Thinketh, it is the lesser known The\
  \ Way of Peace (1907) which reflects more accurately his New Thought Movement affiliations,\
  \ referencing as it does Christianity, Buddhism and Hinduism.\nThe book is essentially\
  \ a treatise on the importance of meditation as a 'pathway to divinity'. Whatever\
  \ we meditate upon, Allen explains, we become. If you meditate upon ' that which\
  \ is selfish and debasing, you will ultimately become selfish and debased'. Whereas\
  \ if you meditate upon ' that which is pure and unselfish you will surely become\
  \ pure and unselfish'.\nIt is now in the public domain within the United States\
  \ and most other countries. It has been released as a Project Gutenberg eText edition.\n\
  The book consists of seven chapters: The Power Of Meditation; The Two Masters, Self\
  \ And Truth; The Acquirement of Spiritual Power; The Realisation of Selfless Love;\
  \ Entering into the Infinite; Saints, Sages, And Saviors, The Law Of Service; and\
  \ The Realisation of Perfect Peace. The first chapter also contains a poem, Star\
  \ of Wisdom, which captures the essence of the book.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
